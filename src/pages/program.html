          <p>We live in a moment of transition. Our institutions don’t deliver the benefits they once did (or seemed to) & it’s impossible to pretend they’re sustainable or inclusive. Young people everywhere are awakening to their larger missions & to the interconnectedness of life.</p>
          <p>As we awaken to this interconnectedness, we see that we cannot change one system without changing the others that support it, and that all of our institutions reflect the dominant culture’s perceptions of the world. And so we are faced with challenging questions that have long, nuanced, & hotly debated answers:</p>

          <p class="italic">How do we change?</p>
          <p class="italic">How do we stop participating in civilization’s exploitative, exclusive, & degenerative systems?</p>
          </div>
          <p>We believe there’s a relatively simple answer to these questions: <span class="bold">We BE the change we want to see.</span> We choose to embody our values & visions, as individuals, as organizations, & as a community.</p>

          <p><span class="bold">We can help you meet others, learn from each other, & work together.</span> We are a network of people & organizations dedicated to an inclusive, regenerative, & sustainable world. So while we may each have distinct goals & focuses in the world, we are all connected at the highest level.</p>
          <p class="italic">We are working toward the same goal, so why do it separately?</p>
