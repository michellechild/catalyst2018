      <p class="org__description">Registration for Catalyst 2018 is $200, however full and partial scholarships are available for students, Board members, and alumni. <span class="bold">Email Connor at <a href="mailto:connor@feelgood.org">connor@feelgood.org</a> or text <a href="tel:>732-677-6195">732-677-6195</a> to request your scholarship, or speak with your Changemaker Ignitor, and we will send you a discount code.</span> All chapters are given two FULL* scholarships to register!"</p>
      <p class="org__description italic">*If you are receiving a full registration scholarship, we will provide a discount code for you that will bring the total balance for registration to $50. However, this $50 is treated as a deposit that is 100% refundable as long as you show up at Catalyst 2018 on August 3rd! The purpose of this is to ensure a free registration doesnâ€™t result in no-shows, but if you have any issue with paying a refundable deposit, please let us know!</p>
