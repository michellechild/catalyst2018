    "roots": "Swipe Out Hunger started at UCLA in 2010 when a few friends went into the dining hall, used their meal cards to take away some sandwiches, and delivered them around town. A few months later the team partnered with Dining Services to allow students to donate their extra dining funds to provide meals for their peers and community members in need. Soon, students from over campuses contacted them asking for help replicating the model on their campus. There are currently 40 Swipe Out Hunger campus partners across the U.S., where students have the option to donate unused dining hall money to their food insecure peers and community.",
    "motivation": "We are excited to be the conduit through with universities can put students' needs are the core of their mission. At UCLA we have only been around for 8 years but our presence has become an institution. So many more universities are out there which presents a huge opportunity to scale. Another thing that motivates us is the fact that very few teams are actively addressing college student hunger at a national scale. There needs to be a national movement so we can shift the norm around the issue.",
    "youth": "Students have been the driving force behind Swipe Out Hunger's growth. Additionally, our focus on ending student hunger leaves many students' voices at the forefront of our work. Swipe Out Hunger works to end student hunger by activating college students to donate unused meal points to feed their peers and community members in need. The organization operates through a network of campus partners, many of which have a cadre of student leaders working directly with university administrators to develop solutions to campus hunger."

    "roots": "Launched in 2012, Up to Us is a rapidly growing, nonpartisan movement of young people who recognize that when it comes to securing their future opportunities, they have no better advocates than themselves. Amid high-profile debates over jobs and the economy, social mobility, healthcare, and tax reform, Up to Us is the only nationwide, campus-based campaign focused on building a sustainable economic and fiscal future for America’s next generation.",
    "motivation": "Up to Us is a unique program provides emerging leaders a unique nonpartisan platform for facilitating a collaborative dialogue on the country’s most vexing challenges.",
    "youth": "Young Americans have the most to gain—or lose—in the debate over America’s fiscal future. Some are motivated by a desire to support investments in crucial priorities like education, research and development, and infrastructure. Others simply want to see their hard work pay off with a secure retirement. Across worldviews and backgrounds, however, the growth of Up to Us is fueled by Millennials who recognize how the nation’s fiscal condition shapes their future opportunities. The Up to Us movement draws on emerging leaders from a wide variety of educational, cultural, geographic and academic backgrounds. From pre-med to political science, from commuter colleges to large private and public universities, and from Alaska to Florida, Up to Us isn’t just a movement of econ wonks and aspiring politicos (though it’s got plenty of those, too). It’s a diverse movement of young, engaged Americans united to build the economic future they want to see."

The Euphrates Institute seeks to imbibe the spirit of the river in amplifying the work of visionaries and connecting peacemakers around the world.",
    "motivation": "The world's problems are global and complex in nature and require each person's participation to solve them. Yet we may often feel helpless and paralyzed in the face of them...and disconnected from each other and the planet. On top of this, we live in a country where war is a trillion-dollar industry and peacebuilders struggle to advance their causes and gain support. We are motivated to shift the narrative, from one of hopelessness, disconnection and conflict to one where each of us feels inspired, connected and empowered to be positive contributors and peacebuilders, not warmakers.",
    "youth": "We have 30 Chapters of young people around the world who are actively involved in their communities to turn 'others' into brothers, and to inform, inspire and transform. Each of them is a visionary and they are the real engine behind our work as they continue to further our mission. Youth are the future and it is our hope that by being active members of the Euphrates Insitute they feel empowered as global citizens, connected to each other and hopeful that change is possible!"
